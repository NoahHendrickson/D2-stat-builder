/**
 * Ceiling-refinement benchmark — gated behind BENCH so `npm test` stays fast and green.
 * Run with: BENCH=1 npx vitest run src/lib/optimizer/ceilings-bench.test.ts
 *
 * Purpose: give each later speedup step (subset-mask bound, witness harvest, bound
 * carryover) a measured baseline to beat, instead of vibes. For each scenario below we
 * solve for a seed (the same seed production would hand to solveCeilings), then run
 * solveCeilings to exact under a 120s budget, and separately measure what a
 * production-shaped 1200ms budget (CEILING_BUDGET_MS, see solve.ts) settles.
 *
 * BASELINE (captured 2026-07-03, Node vitest, this machine, uncached JIT — single run,
 * not averaged; later steps should re-run this same file for a fair before/after):
 *
 * Scenario: realWarlockTwoSetInput (180/0/0/105/0/0, exotic require, two 2pc sets)
 *   seed:            [180, 38, 85, 125, 110, 71]
 *   time to exact:   22139 ms
 *   stats:           { probes: 37, feasible: 19, disproven: 18, timedOut: 0, nodes: 143011403 }
 *   exact ceilings:  [200, 55, 115, 145, 125, 105]
 *   at 1200ms:       ceilings [200, 53, 95, 140, 110, 75], exact=false,
 *                    stats { probes: 37, feasible: 15, disproven: 2, timedOut: 20, nodes: 8175617 }
 *
 * Scenario: realWarlockCodaInput (190/0/0/120/0/0, CODA 4pc, mods 3/2, frag [0,0,10,-20,0,0])
 *   seed:            [190, 41, 96, 120, 71, 71]
 *   time to exact:   1442 ms
 *   stats:           { probes: 38, feasible: 16, disproven: 22, timedOut: 0, nodes: 9660887 }
 *   exact ceilings:  [200, 60, 120, 130, 95, 95]
 *   at 1200ms:       ceilings [200, 60, 120, 130, 95, 95], exact=false (all values found,
 *                    6 probes still timing out unproven),
 *                    stats { probes: 38, feasible: 16, disproven: 16, timedOut: 6, nodes: 8114177 }
 *
 * Takeaway: the two-set scenario (joint weapon+grenade minimums, small pool after the
 * exotic filter) is the expensive one — proving exactness costs 22s and 143M DFS nodes,
 * and at the production inline budget 20 of 37 probes time out having proven nothing.
 * The CODA scenario finds every final value within 1200ms but still can't PROVE them
 * inside the budget (6 timed-out probes) — exactness proofs, not discovery, are the
 * bottleneck in both.
 *
 * After Step 1 (subset-mask bound) — captured 2026-07-03, same machine, single run:
 *
 * Scenario: realWarlockTwoSetInput (180/0/0/105/0/0, exotic require, two 2pc sets)
 *   seed:            [180, 38, 85, 125, 110, 71]
 *   time to exact:   9216 ms
 *   stats:           { probes: 37, feasible: 19, disproven: 18, timedOut: 0, nodes: 63326456 }
 *   exact ceilings:  [200, 55, 115, 145, 125, 105]   (identical to baseline — no drift)
 *   at 1200ms:       ceilings [200, 55, 109, 144, 123, 84], exact=false,
 *                    stats { probes: 36, feasible: 14, disproven: 8, timedOut: 14, nodes: 8408068 }
 *
 * Scenario: realWarlockCodaInput (190/0/0/120/0/0, CODA 4pc, mods 3/2, frag [0,0,10,-20,0,0])
 *   seed:            [190, 41, 96, 120, 71, 71]
 *   time to exact:   116 ms
 *   stats:           { probes: 38, feasible: 16, disproven: 22, timedOut: 0, nodes: 743733 }
 *   exact ceilings:  [200, 60, 120, 130, 95, 95]   (identical to baseline — no drift)
 *   at 1200ms:       ceilings [200, 60, 120, 130, 95, 95], exact=TRUE at 114ms —
 *                    the production inline budget now PROVES this scenario,
 *                    stats { probes: 38, feasible: 16, disproven: 22, timedOut: 0, nodes: 743733 }
 *
 * Step 1 takeaway: CODA collapsed 1442ms/9.66M nodes → 116ms/744k (~12x) and is now
 * exact INSIDE the inline budget. Two-set improved 22.1s/143M → 9.2s/63M (~2.4x) —
 * real but not a collapse: its remaining cost sits in probes whose infeasibility isn't
 * a two-stat conservation argument (the mask fires at the root or not at all there),
 * which is what witness harvest / bound carryover (Steps 2–3) target. Exact ceilings
 * are bit-identical to baseline in both scenarios, as an admissible tightening must be.
 *
 * After Step 2 (witness harvest) — captured 2026-07-03, same machine, single run:
 *
 * Scenario: realWarlockTwoSetInput (180/0/0/105/0/0, exotic require, two 2pc sets)
 *   seed:            [180, 38, 85, 125, 110, 71]
 *   time to exact:   8593 ms
 *   stats:           { probes: 30, feasible: 11, disproven: 19, timedOut: 0, nodes: 61852167 }
 *   exact ceilings:  [200, 55, 115, 145, 125, 105]   (bit-identical to Step 1 / baseline)
 *   at 1200ms:       ceilings [200, 55, 110, 145, 125, 90], exact=false,
 *                    stats { probes: 31, feasible: 10, disproven: 9, timedOut: 12, nodes: 8630273 }
 *
 * Scenario: realWarlockCodaInput (190/0/0/120/0/0, CODA 4pc, mods 3/2, frag [0,0,10,-20,0,0])
 *   seed:            [190, 41, 96, 120, 71, 71]
 *   time to exact:   99 ms
 *   stats:           { probes: 29, feasible: 9, disproven: 20, timedOut: 0, nodes: 664374 }
 *   exact ceilings:  [200, 60, 120, 130, 95, 95]   (bit-identical to Step 1 / baseline)
 *   at 1200ms:       ceilings [200, 60, 120, 130, 95, 95], exact=TRUE at 98ms,
 *                    stats { probes: 29, feasible: 9, disproven: 20, timedOut: 0, nodes: 664374 }
 *
 * Step 2 takeaway: harvest removes redundant probes by proving several stats' ceilings
 * from ONE feasible probe's witness build — the coupled stat never probes. Two-set
 * to-exact 37→30 probes (feasible 19→11: the eliminated 8 are exactly the probes a
 * discarded witness had already demonstrated), 9.2s→8.6s, 63.3M→61.9M nodes. CODA
 * 38→29 probes (feasible 16→9), 116→99ms. Modest wall-clock wins here because the
 * survivors are the EXPENSIVE disproof probes (harvest can't shortcut an impossibility
 * proof — only rediscovery), which is what bound carryover (Step 3) targets. Exact
 * ceilings bit-identical to Step 1 in both scenarios — harvest only raises the proven
 * low side, never the optimistic bound, so it cannot over- or under-report a maximum.
 *
 * After Step 3 (bound provenance) — captured 2026-07-03, same machine, single run.
 * NEW: three to-exact variants isolate what the upperSeed carryover alone buys.
 * Production's background phase 1 ALREADY seeds with the inline pass's ceilings
 * (session.ts passes them as the achievable seed) — so (b), not (a), is the pre-Step-3
 * background baseline, and the (b) vs (c) delta is Step 3's true production effect:
 *   (a) cold top-N seed        — the historical to-exact number (comparable to Steps 1–2);
 *   (b) inline-ceilings seed   — status-quo background-after-inline (no upperSeed);
 *   (c) inline ceilings+uppers — Step 3's background-after-inline.
 *
 * Scenario: realWarlockTwoSetInput (180/0/0/105/0/0, exotic require, two 2pc sets)
 *   seed:            [180, 38, 85, 125, 110, 71]
 *   at 1200ms:       ceilings [200, 55, 105, 145, 125, 90], uppers [200,135,132,145,154,125],
 *                    exact=false,
 *                    stats { probes: 31, feasible: 11, disproven: 8, timedOut: 12, nodes: 7849985 }
 *   (a) cold:        9533 ms,
 *                    stats { probes: 30, feasible: 11, disproven: 19, timedOut: 0, nodes: 61852167 }
 *   (b) status quo:  15623 ms,
 *                    stats { probes: 28, feasible: 3, disproven: 25, timedOut: 0, nodes: 108993125 }
 *   (c) Step 3:      14921 ms,
 *                    stats { probes: 18, feasible: 3, disproven: 15, timedOut: 0, nodes: 105341290 }
 *   exact ceilings:  [200, 55, 115, 145, 125, 105]   (bit-identical across a/b/c and Steps 1–2)
 *
 * Scenario: realWarlockCodaInput (190/0/0/120/0/0, CODA 4pc, mods 3/2, frag [0,0,10,-20,0,0])
 *   seed:            [190, 41, 96, 120, 71, 71]
 *   at 1200ms:       ceilings [200, 60, 120, 130, 95, 95], uppers identical, exact=TRUE at 106ms,
 *                    stats { probes: 29, feasible: 9, disproven: 20, timedOut: 0, nodes: 664374 }
 *   (a) cold:        104 ms,
 *                    stats { probes: 29, feasible: 9, disproven: 20, timedOut: 0, nodes: 664374 }
 *   (b) status quo:  87 ms — every value already at its ceiling, yet all 30 probes are
 *                    DISPROOFS re-run purely to re-close the upper windows,
 *                    stats { probes: 30, feasible: 0, disproven: 30, timedOut: 0, nodes: 512526 }
 *   (c) Step 3:      1 ms, ZERO probes — the carried uppers==ceilings settle every stat,
 *                    stats { probes: 0, feasible: 0, disproven: 0, timedOut: 0, nodes: 0 }
 *   exact ceilings:  [200, 60, 120, 130, 95, 95]   (bit-identical across a/b/c and Steps 1–2)
 *
 * Step 3 takeaway ((b) vs (c) is the production effect): the carryover eliminates exactly
 * the re-proof probes. CODA: 30 probes/87ms → 0 probes/1ms — the whole status-quo
 * background pass was redundant re-proving, and Step 3 deletes it. Two-set: probes 28→18
 * and disproven 25→15 (the 10 skipped are re-proofs of shrinks the inline pass certified),
 * nodes 109M→105M, 15.6s→14.9s (~5%) — modest wall-clock because the skipped disproofs are
 * the CHEAP low-`mid` ones; the surviving high-`mid` disproofs dominate cost. Note (b) vs
 * (a): seeding ceilings alone makes the two-set background SLOWER than cold (15.6s vs
 * 9.5s, 109M vs 62M nodes) — a pre-existing status-quo property (higher starting ceilings
 * push every probe into the expensive tight-window regime), NOT a Step 3 regression;
 * Step 3 strictly improves on (b) in both scenarios. Exact ceilings stay bit-identical
 * across all variants and Steps 1–2 — uppers only ever shrink on a PROVEN infeasible
 * probe, so the reported maxima can't drift.
 *
 * After Step 4 (edit-loop carryover) — captured 2026-07-03, same machine, single run.
 * NEW edit-loop scenario: this is the adjust-a-slider-then-wait loop the whole plan
 * targets. Solve query A (realWarlockTwoSetInput, grenade ≥105) to a proven-exact output,
 * then TIGHTEN grenade 105→120 and time the tightened query's to-exact WITH the cross-edit
 * carry (carried achievable lows + carried proven uppers from computeCeilingCarry) vs COLD
 * (the tightened query's own top-N seed, no uppers). This measures the actual user-facing
 * win: what a slider bump costs when the prior query's bounds carry over vs from scratch.
 *
 * Scenario: edit-loop realWarlockTwoSetInput (grenade 105→120)
 *   A exact ceilings: [200, 55, 115, 145, 125, 105]
 *   carry seed:       [180, 38, 85, 125, 105, 71]   (survivor-derived achievable lows)
 *   carry upperSeed:  [200, 55, 115, 145, 125, 105] (query A's proven uppers)
 *   COLD to exact:    4730 ms,
 *                     ceilings [200, 55, 110, 145, 125, 105],
 *                     stats { probes: 31, feasible: 11, disproven: 20, timedOut: 0, nodes: 32772917 }
 *   CARRY to exact:   448 ms,
 *                     ceilings [200, 55, 110, 145, 125, 105]  (bit-identical to COLD),
 *                     stats { probes: 19, feasible: 17, disproven: 2, timedOut: 0, nodes: 2569017 }
 *
 * Step 4 takeaway: the carry turns a ~4.7s re-derivation into ~0.45s — ~10.5x faster,
 * ~12.8x fewer DFS nodes (32.8M → 2.6M), probes 31→19 with disproven collapsing 20→2 (the
 * carried uppers close most stats' upper windows before any expensive disproof runs, so the
 * survivors are mostly cheap feasible re-confirmations). Same exact answer as COLD — carry
 * only removes re-proof work; it never changes a ceiling. The two prior scenarios re-run in
 * this same pass and their exact ceilings stay bit-identical to Steps 1–3
 * ([200,55,115,145,125,105] and [200,60,120,130,95,95]): Step 4 adds only OPTIONAL seeds to
 * the first solve, so the cold path is untouched.
