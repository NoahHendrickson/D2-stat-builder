 * Leaf module: the tiny shared stat constants plus the `raiseAchievableFloors` primitive.

 * and `NUM_STATS` WITHOUT transitively pulling in the ~1300-line solver (solve.ts) or the
 * tuning searcher (tuning.ts). Keep this module dependency-free at runtime (type-only imports
 * are fine) so it stays a genuine leaf. tuning.ts and solve.ts import these back out of here.

 * Raise each of `floors` to what a single real build proves is achievable for that stat:
 * the build's final `stats[s]` PLUS its spare mod capacity (every mod point not consumed
 * by the build) dumped into that ONE stat, clamped to STAT_CAP. Mutates `floors` in place;
 * returns whether any floor rose.
 *
 * Why every raised value is achievable: the build already meets the query's minimums, and
 * mods are only auto-assigned to cover deficits — so its unspent capacity could genuinely
 * be re-socketed into any single stat while the other five keep their achieved values
 * (still ≥ their minimums). This is the shared primitive behind both the top-N seed dump
 * and the ceiling witness harvest. (Feasible-mode witnesses don't dump leftover artifice
 * +3s, so a harvested value can slightly UNDER-state the true max — it stays a valid lower
 * bound, never an over-report.)
